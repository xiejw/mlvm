\subtitle{Conv2D and its Gradients from Math Perspective}

{\leftskip=\descindent

\itembox{Forward Pass}%
%
Conv2D is quite simple. Given $X, W$, and $Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are
the input and output respectively and $W$ is a typically quite small kernel, we
denote the formula as
%
$$ Y = X \conv W. $$

\noindent Assuming the padding is {\tt same}, which means the shape of the
output $Y$ is same as the shape of input $X$, denocated as $<m, n>$ and, $W$ has
odd number of rows and columns, denoted as $<a,b>$, then we have
%
$$ Y_{i,j} =
    \sum_{x=0}^{a-1} \sum_{y=0}^{b-1}
        X_{i+x-{a-1 \over 2},j+y-{b-1 \over 2}} W_{x,y}.
$$
where $0\le i \le m-1$ and $0\le j \le n -1$. Here, there is a hidden padding in
the input $X$, i.e., for any coordinates out of the boundaries, the input value
is zero.

\itembox{Grad of~$X$}%
%
If we examine the Jacobian matrix, each column, i.e., for a fixed input $x$, has
$ab$ non-zero elements, due to the kernel shape $<a,b>$. And due to the
symmetricity, it is trivial to prove:
%
$$ dX = dY \conv W'. $$
where the padding is still {\tt same} and $W'$ is a matrix with same shape
$<a,b>$ as $W$, but all elements reversed, i.e.,
$$ W' =
\left[
  \matrix{
    W_{a-1,b-1} & W_{a-1, b-2} & \ldots & W_{a-1, 0} \cr
    W_{a-2,b-1} & W_{a-2, b-2} & \ldots & W_{a-2, 0} \cr
    \vdots      & \vdots       & \ddots & \vdots \cr
    W_{0,b-1}   & W_{0, b-2}   & \ldots & W_{0, 0}
  }
\right]
$$

\itembox{Grad of~$W$}%
%
For the central point of $W$, the gradient is
%
$$
dW_{{a-1\over2}, {b-1\over2}} = dY \odot X
$$
%
So, we can summerize the gradients for each point of $W$ as
%
$$
dW_{x+{a-1\over2}, y+{b-1\over2}} = dY_{\triangleright (x,y)} \odot X
$$
where $-{a-1\over2} \le x \le {a-1\over2}, -{b-1\over2} \le y \le {b-1\over2}$
and $\triangleright (x,y)$ means shifting the matrix to right with $(x,y)$
offsets.
