\noindent {\subtitlefont From user's view}, Tensor a multi-dimension float-value
array. For a Tensor with shape $<a, b, c>$, where $a,b,$ and $c$ are all
positive integers, there are in total of $ a b c $ number of elements, called
{\tt size}, in it.  The length of the shape is called {\tt rank}. It is also the
number of dimensions. Scalar is viewed as a Tensor with shape $<1>$, i.e., rank
$1$.

  \itembox{value mode}{}The first one is ownership, called {\tt value-mode\_},
  which is an internal field. It represents whether the current Tensor owns its
  value buffer.
