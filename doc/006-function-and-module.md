Difference
----------

- `Function` is the basic funtional unit for computation. It is composible and
  should support high-order diffireitaction.

- `Container` stores the persistence array.

- `Module` is the unit to compile the function and run it. In addition, it
  supports partial outputs, subset of function, or parameter writes.

- We could run a single Fn.
